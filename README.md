Sqlcx (sqlcipher interface for Elixir)
======================================

An Elixir wrapper around [esqlcipher](https://github.com/FelixKiunke/esqlcipher). The main aim here is to provide convenient usage of sqlcipher databases (encrypted SQLite).

Important Note
==============
This is a fork of the 'regular' sqlite variant ([sqlitex](https://github.com/elixir-sqlite/sqlitex)).
It is not finished yet and lots of things might change later on. Proceed with care :)

# Updated to 1.0

With the 1.0 release, we made just a single breaking change. `Sqlcx.Query.query` previously returned just the raw query results on success and `{:error, reason}` on failure.
This has been bothering us for a while, so we changed it in 1.0 to return `{:ok, results}` on success and `{:error, reason}` on failure.
This should make it easier to pattern match on. The `Sqlcx.Query.query!` function has kept its same functionality of returning bare results on success and raising an error on failure.

# Usage

The simple way to use Sqlcx is just to open a database and run a query

```elixir
Sqlcx.with_db('test/fixtures/golfscores.sqlite3', fn(db) ->
  Sqlcx.query(db, "SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY id LIMIT 1")
end)
# => [[id: 1, name: "Mikey", created_at: {{2012,10,14},{05,46,28}}, updated_at: {{2013,09,06},{22,29,36}}, type: nil]]

Sqlcx.with_db('test/fixtures/golfscores.sqlite3', fn(db) ->
  Sqlcx.query(db, "SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY id LIMIT 1", into: %{})
end)
# => [%{id: 1, name: "Mikey", created_at: {{2012,10,14},{05,46,28}}, updated_at: {{2013,09,06},{22,29,36}}, type: nil}]
```

Pass the `bind` option to bind parameterized queries.

```elixir
Sqlcx.with_db('test/fixtures/golfscores.sqlite3', fn(db) ->
  Sqlcx.query(
    db,
    "INSERT INTO players (name, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4)",
    bind: ['Mikey', '2012-10-14 05:46:28.318107', '2013-09-06 22:29:36.610911']
  )
end)
# => [[id: 1, name: "Mikey", created_at: {{2012,10,14},{05,46,28}}, updated_at: {{2013,09,06},{22,29,36}}, type: nil]]
```

If you want to keep the database open during the lifetime of your project you can use the `Sqlcx.Server` GenServer module.

`start_link` takes an options [db_password: "password"] tuple; password can be `nil`.

Here's a sample from a phoenix projects main supervisor definition.

```elixir
children = [
      # Start the endpoint when the application starts
      worker(Golf.Endpoint, []),
      worker(Sqlcx.Server, ["golf.db", [db_password: "password", name: Gold.DB]])
    ]
```

Now that the GenServer is running you can make queries via
```elixir
Sqlcx.Server.query(Golf.DB,
                     "SELECT g.id, g.course_id, g.played_at, c.name AS course
                      FROM games AS g
                      INNER JOIN courses AS c ON g.course_id = c.id
                      ORDER BY g.played_at DESC LIMIT 10")
```

# Configuration

Sqlcx uses the Erlang library [esqlcipher](https://github.com/FelixKiunke/esqlcipher)
which accepts a timeout parameter for almost all interactions with the database.
The default value for this timeout is 5000 ms. Many functions in Sqlcx accept
a `:db_timeout` option that is passed on to the esqlite calls and also defaults
to 5000 ms. If required, this default value can be overridden globally with the
following in your `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :sqlcx, db_timeout: 10_000 # or other positive integer number of ms
```

Another esqlite parameter is :db_chunk_size.
This is a count of rows to read from native sqlite and send to erlang process in one bulk.
For example, consider a table `mytable` that has 1000 rows. We make the query to get all rows with `db_chunk_size: 500` parameter:
```elixir
Sqlcx.query(db, "select * from mytable", db_chunk_size: 500)
```
in this case all rows will be passed from native sqlite OS thread to the erlang process in two passes.
Each pass will contain 500 rows.
This parameter decrease overhead of transmitting rows from native OS sqlite thread to the erlang process by
chunking list of result rows. 
Please decrease this value if rows are heavy. Default value is 5000.  
If youâ€™re in doubt what to do with this parameter, just leave it as is. The default value will be ok in almost all cases.
```elixir
config :sqlcx, db_chunk_size: 500 # if most of the database rows are heavy
```

An [SQLCipher Ecto2 adapter](https://github.com/FelixKiunke/sqlcipher_ecto) is in the works but is not finished yet.
